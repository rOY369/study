* Notes

  - WU WEI
    - Not doing
    - Non action
    - Inaction
  - You can accomplish everything by doing nothing.
  - Effortless action / unforced action
  - Sincere action
  - To act without wei is to remove the social, conceptual character
    from our behavior and act on `natural instinct or intuition`.
  - To act without wei is to act without any `shoulds`.
  - There is no outer authority to follow blindly. There is only `this
    seems best to me based on my current knowledge and experience.`
  - right understanding --> right actions
  - But our understanding of the world is flawed and incomplete.
  - Sincerety --> learning --> understanding
  - Involvement --> learning
  - (Involvement = sincerety + feedback) --> learning
  - Sincerety is when you act genuinely in a way that seems best to
    you, not dependent on external authority.
  - Feedback is when you are not sheltered from the consequences of
    your actions, for better or worse.
  - (Sincerety + Feedback) --> involvement --> learning -->
    understanding --> action
