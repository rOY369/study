* Notes

  - Tiny changes in our habits can change the trajectory of our lives drastically.
  - You are your habits.
  - massive action vs 1% improvement
    - we expect ourselves to make some quantum leap that will gain
      others attention.
    - however it is the tiny improvements that are not noticable at
      first, that create incredible change.
    - success is the product of daily habits, not once in a lifetime transformations.
    - The valley of dissappointment is where most people fail and slip
      back into their old routines.
    - The most powerful outcomes of any compounding process are
      delayed so patience is required.
  - Forget about goals, focus on systems instead
    - goal is the result you want to accomplish, systems deal with
      processes that lead to the results.
    - convention is that to get success --> set specific realistic goals
    - goals are good for setting a direction but systems are best for
      making progress
  - System of atomic habits
    - the problem is not that you dont want to change. the problem is
      that you have the wrong system for change.
    - what really matters is the daily actions and decisions we take
  - Three layers of behavior change
    - changing outcomes
    - process
    - changing your identity
      - what do you believe
      - your worldviews
      - what do you think about yourself and others
  - Most people focus on outcomes. But the best way to change habits
    is to focus on person you want to become.
    - The goal is not to learn an instrument. it is to become a musician.
    - Remind yourself everytime you do a workout, you are an athlete.
    - every time you write a line of code, you are a pro software dev.
    - each time you instruct your team, you are a leader.
  - A habit loop
    - habit is formed and reinforced by means of continuous feedback loop.
      - cue --> craving --> response --> reward
      - checking social media becomes tied to your mind going blank at work.
  - 4 laws
    - 1 : make it obvious
      - first become aware of your habits
      - make a habit scorecard
      - time and location are the most common cues
      - I will [behaviour] at [time] in [location]
      - habits stacking : after [current habit] i will [new
        habit]. A chain of habits is more likely to be sustained if
        it is practiced consistently.
      - motivation is highly overrated. We are more influenced by
        our environment than our willpower or motivation. Creating a
        habit requires you to redesign the space around you. Context
        is the cue.
        - stop seeing your environment as a place filled with
          objects. Imagine it as a place filled with relationships.
        - try to make separate zones in your house for different
          activities. One space one use.
        - One of the practical ways to eliminate a bad habit is to
          make it invisible. Eliminate it from your environment.
    - 2 : make it attractive
      - we are more motivated to act when our dopamine levels rise.
      - it is the expectation of a rewarding experience that drives us
        to act
      - temptation bundling : combine an action we need to do with one
        we want to do.
      - group influence
        - what will others think of me ?
        - find groups to join where the habit you desire is the norm
      - underlying motives
        - your habits are modern day solutions to ancient desires. new
          versions of old vices. the underlying motives behind human
          behavior remain the same.
      - learn to associate hard habits with a positive experience
        - fitness = health + wellbeing, fitness != fatigue
      - to break a bad habit : make it unattractive
    - 3 : make it easy
      - the more energy required, the less likely it is to happen.
      - reduce friction with good habits and increase friction with
        bad habits.
      - find a simple 2 minute version of your desired habit.
      - get the routine anchored in place and then slowly build up the
        difficulty.
    - 4 : make it satisfying
      - what is immediately rewarded is repeated. what is immediately
        punished is avoided.
      - good to add a little immediate pleasure to the habits that
        will pay off in the long run.
      - monitor your progress using visual measures. celebrate little
        wins.
      - use a habit tracker.
      - bad days
        - don't break the chain of continuity.
    - Good habits : obvious, attractive, easy, satisfying
    - Bad habits : invisible, unattractive, difficult, unsatisfying
