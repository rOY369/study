* Network Layer / IP Addressing

** IP Address

*** Basic 

   - IP Addressing works in the layer 3 network layer.
   - The network layer needs to be able to move traffic from one
     device on internet to some other device.
   - every device connected on the internet must have a unique
     identifier at layer three.
   - IP address is 4 numbers
     - each number within the range 0-255
     - 203.0.113.10
     - [[file:./pictures/ip_address_components.png]]
     - Network portion same as zip code representing the geographical area
       - tells us what larger group of ip addresses, this specific ip
         address is a part of.  
     - Host portion same as home address like house no.
       - what device we are working with in a larger group of network

    
*** Construction

    - Ip address is a 32 bit value broken into 4 octets
    - [[file:./pictures/ip_address_construction.png]]
    - Which is the network and host portion is decided why which type
      of addressing is used.
*** Classful and Classless Addressing

    - Classless addressing (after 2000)
      - subnet mask is going to determine the network portion and host
        portion of the address
      - subnet mask combined with the ip address will very quickly
        tell the division line between the network portion and host
        portion of the ip address.
      - [[file:./pictures/subnet_mask.png]]
      - first 24 bits represent network portion
      - very last octet will be host portion
      - The division line can be anywhere within the address
      - [[file:/pictures/subnet_mask_2.png]]
      - [[file:./pictures/subnet_mask_3.png]]
    - Classful addressing (before 2000)
      - [[file:./pictures/ip_classes.png]]
      - initially, ip addressing was not designed to use a subnet mask.
      - the class of the address was used to determine which portion
        is network portion and which portion is host.
      - Unicast is class A,B,C. --> the only usable addresses we have
        on the public internet range b/w 0.0.0.0 and 223.255.255.255
      - Unicast communication is when we have one single device trying
        to talk to another single device on the internet.
      - Class D is multicast means we can talk from one device to many
        devices. This is not supported on public internet, however
        supported within enterprise organisations to do things like
        live video streaming.
      - everything on public internet is unicast even netflix streaming.

      - [[file:./pictures/class_b.png]]
      - [[file:./pictures/class_c.png]]
      - [[file:./pictures/class_d.png]]
      - class e is experimental
*** IP Address Types


    - Network address/prefix : identifier for a group of devices : a
      set of ip addresses 
    - Broadcast address : identifier for all devices on a network : as
      an address that can be used to send a message to all the devices
      of the network at once.
    - Host address : uniquely identifies a device on the network
    - Network address
      - Subnet mask + ip address --> we can identify the network address.
      - If all 0's in the host portion, then the address is a network
        address and only a network address.
    - Broadcast address
      - If all 1's in the host portion, then the address is a
        broadcast address
    - Host address
      - If neither all 1's nor all 0's in the host portion

*** CIDR (Classless Inter Domain Routing)

    - framework of representing network prefix
    - count number of bits in the network portion
    - [[file:./pictures/cidr_notation.png]]
    - example
      - 203.0.113.10 with mask 255.255.255.0
      - length of network portion = 24
      - cidr notation = 203.0.113.10/24
    - IPv6 addresses are all written in cidr notation

*** Private IP Address Ranges

    - Some addresses are preserved for private use, not usable on
      public internet.
    - [[file:./pictures/private_ip_address_range.png]]
    - These are not routable on public internet
    - APIPA address : automatic private ip addressing
      - 169.254.0.0/16
      - don't often work
      - means something wrong in the network
      - device is not getting correct ip address
    - 127.0.0.1 = loopback address
      - used to test the IP stack or TCP/IP stack on the operating
        system is working correctly
    - Gateway and router are same thing
    - In order for 2 devices to communicate, they must be on the same
      IP network i.e with same network portion.
    - If they are not on the same network, we need to add another
      device like a router to facilitate that communication.
 
*** IP Address subnetting

    - Network address is the very first address in our range of
      addresses.
    - Broadcast address is the very last address in a range of
      addresses.
    - 10.0.0.0/8 = private ip address
      - first 8 bits = network portion
      - then 24 bits = host portion = 16 million devices
      - we want a smalled ip address range
      - another representation : 10.0.0.0/8 with subnet mask 255.0.0.0
      - range of addresses : 10.0.0.0(network address) -
        10.255.255.255(broadcast address)
      - 10.0.10.0 is a host address on the 10.0.0.0/8 network
        - we can move the subnet from /8 to /24
        - first 24 bits = network portion
        - then 8 bits = host portion
        - 10.0.10.0/24
        - network address = 10.0.10.0
        - broadcast address = 10.0.10.255
      - 10.0.10.0/24 is a range of addresses that falls within the
        10.0.0.0/8 grouping.
