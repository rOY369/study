* Protocols and Port Numbers

  - Mainly this is about the application layer protocols.
  
** HTTP / HTTPS

   [[file:pictures/http.png]]

   - HTTPs : Hyper text transfer protocol secure : encrypted transfer
     meaning all the data communicated between client and server is
     encrypted.
   - Nearly all application protocols require the client-server model.
   - It is sending a file in format of hyper text : way of formatting
     a document readable by web browser.
   - Mechanism on client side : web clients (browser)
   - Mechanism on server side : server software like apache, nginx
     etc. in order to host a website on the internet.
   - client and server work in conjunction with each other to transfer
     the hyper text documents in order to get the website from server
     to client.
   - Every layer 7 (application) protocol has a layer 4 (transport)
     component which is port number. Port number uniquely identifies
     the layer 7 protocol being used at layer 4. We can thus use these
     port numbers to easily identify traffic at layer 4 so that the
     computing systems understand how to interpret the traffic and
     what layer 7 protocol to send the particular message to.
   - HTTP : default port = 80
   - HTTPs : default port = 443
** File Transfer Protocol 

   - We can transfer a file from client --> server or server -->
     client.
   - FTP, sFTP (secure) , TFTP (trivial file transfer protocol)
   - TFTP
     - meant for sending tiny files
     - having simple setups to transfer files quickly without auth or
       issues with firewalls
   - FTP, sFTP typically require username and password but TFTP does not.
   - sFTP is going to encrypt the traffic
   - FTP : default port = 20 (transfer), 21(auth)
   - sFTP : default port = 22
     - 22 is port number for another protocol called ssh (secure shell)
     - we take the ftp protocol inside the ssh session which allows us
       to encrypt the traffic
   - TFTP : default port = 69
   - SMB : server message block : default port = 445
     - example : mounting of some type of network drive on a system
       which allows you to add files to the server or copy files from
       the server.
