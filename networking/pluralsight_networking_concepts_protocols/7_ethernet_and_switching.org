* Basic : what is Ethernet ? 


  - Ethernet is layer 2 i.e data link layer protocol.
  - Ethernet, Frame, Switch == data link protocol 
  - The data link layer is responsible for protocols that allow
    traffic to move in between the devices that are locally connected
    together i.e from one end of cable to other end of cable.
  - Two unique distinct types of ethernet : wired and wireless

* CSMA/CD

  - Carrier sense multiple access with collision detection
  - [[file:./pictures/bus_network.png]]
  - If any device wants to send a message to any of the devices on the
    network, It will send a pulse of electricity --> +5V or -5v or no
    volt.
  - This signal of on and off allows us to transfer a message i.e
    pulse of 0 and 1.
  - So if any one of the devices send a message, all the other devices
    on the network also hear the same message. Only the message it was
    intended to receive will typically respond.
  - Here multiple access means all the devices are sharing the same
    wire.
  - If any one device is already sending a message, another device
    will have to wait until the device is done sending its msg.
  - It is easy to have an accident when both devices listen to the
    wire and hear that nodody is talking, in that case both devices
    will start sending the msgs at the same time. Collision occurs.
  - This will create a pulse of more than 5V.
  - All devices are designed to recognize this surge.
  - The network stops the conversation, all devices back off and wait
    a random period of time and then start listen to wire again if it
    is ready to send the data.
  - Carrier sense : devices listening to the wire
  - Multiple access : devices sharing the same wire
  - collision detection : if device hears a surge of voltage, network
    creates a collision, all devices will stop listening, discard
    anything that they have just received and wait and start over again.
* Duplex and Speed

  - Half duplex : only one device can communicate at a time
    - similar to walkie talkie
  - Full duplex : two devices can communicate at the same time
    - similar to telephone
    - collision not possible
  - Modern collision domain is only going to be a half duplex
    connection b/w a pc and switch
* Ethernet Frame

  - Ethernet 2
  - Frame is the mechanism by which we send data across ethernet
    network from one device to another.
  - [[file:./pictures/ethernet_frame.png]]
  - data(payload):
    - layer 2 information or some layer 3 information (most likely an
      IP packet)
    - data we actually transfer
    - MTU :maximum transmission unit : 1500 bytes
  - frame == chunk of data + data link layer header (ethernet header)
  - ethernet header
    - layer 2 identifiers specifically tied to a network interface
      - hardware address
      - Manufacture ID(first 24 bits) : Serial ID(next 24 bits)
      - 00:10:D9:D7:52:7A
      - These mac addresses are burned on to the network interface cards
      - destination mac address
      - source mac address
    - Type : type of data. is it layer 3 data or some other data
    - FCS : frame check sequence
      - cyclic redundancy check
      - sender takes all the information in the frame, runs it through
        an algo and computes a value and that value is put in the 32
        bit field at the end of frame called FCS
      - receiver does the same calculation again and checks whether
        the FCS value is matching
  - protocol data unit varies from layer to layer of the OSI model
    - layer 2 pdu contains the entire frame : source address,
      destination address, type, fcs and the data itself.
* Network Topologies

  - Bus
  - Ring
    - token ring competitor of ethernet
    - [[file:./pictures/ring_network.png]]
    - token spins around a ring
    - as devices need to transfer data, they will attach data to this token
    - as another device would the receive the message, it would take
      the message off the token, put it back on the wire and process
      will start over again 
  - Star (modern ethernet)
    - [[file:./pictures/star_network.png]]
    - this topology originally came from using hub
    - this device is a hub : layer 1 device
    - hub is nothing but a multi-port repeater
    - when a device puts a message, all the others are going to hear it
    - If 2 devices send a message at the same time, there will be a
      collision at the hub
    - switching takes care of that
  - layer 2 switch
    - switch breaks up collision domains
    - switch maintains a mac address table
    - it reads the frame headers and save the source mac address in
      the mac address table corresponding to the port number
    - it checks from the table which port belongs to the destination
      mac address and forwards the message only to this port
    - this creates a virtual circuit inside the switch
    - now we can have multiple devices talking at the same time
    - no collisions occur here
  - Broadcast message
    - ethernet is considered to be a broadcast network type
    - [[file:./pictures/ethernet_broadcast.png]]
    - When the destination mac address of the frame is all F's, the
      frame is sent out all active interfaces, excpept the receiving
      interface.
    - Broadcast domain
      - group of networked devices which will receive a layer 2
        broadcast message
