* OSI Model

  - Open Systems Interconnect
  - Watching youtube video
    - My system : wireless router through WiFi / LAN : ISP(Modem) :
      Internet : Youtube Server
    - Type in https://www.youtube.com
    - Goes to Youtube server --> pulls up the video
    - Transfers it to my system

** Physical Layer

   - wireless/wired cables (twister pair cables: non-identical)
   - modem - internet : CoAx cable
   - internet : fiber optics / wireless / copper
   - All of these cables and the protocols that define how those
     cables are constructed are physical layer
     protocols. Example : twister pair cabling require a very
     precise protocol to understand how to construct it, same
     thing with other types of cables. Even the wireless
     connections use electronmagnetic spectrum to transfer
     information.

** Data Link Layer

   - Protocols required to move information from one end of the cable
     to another end of the cable. So we end up having mini-network
     segments (marked as blue in the following picture)
   - A network segment is a collection of network devices that operate
     in the same space in the same protocol.
   - In each of the network segments in the picture, a specific
     protocol is used to manage and transfer the data.

     [[file:pictures/network_segment.png]]
     
   - Most of the segments in the picture use wired/wireless
     ethernet. For example : computer-router, router-modem,
     internet-server.
   - cable modem - isp uses DOCSIS-3 (data over cable service
     interface specification)
   - internet is mainly ethernet --> extremely high speed
     communication (100Gb/s)
   - These protocols are part of data link layer : place where we move
     data from one device to another device in very small short little
     hops. 

** Network Layer

   - The data link layer is responsible for moving traffic between the
     components of a network segment. For example ethernet within the
     first segment moves information only between the computer and
     router i.e the communication is done only between short hops.
   - But we also need communication between different network
     segments. For example computer - cable modem. 
   - IP Addressing to allow us to send messages along longer distances.
     - IP Address is just like a home address. It is a unique address of
       all the devices on the internet.
   - IP Routing allows us to send messages from one unique address to
     another.
   - Ethernet, IP addressing and IP routing work closely together to
     communicate.

** Transport Layer

   - Before we can ask the server to send us the website information,
     we have to setup some kind of session in between the client and
     server. (similar to telephone call)
   - TCP Transmission control protocol allows us to build the session.

** Application Layer

   - Need a protocol that allows to transfer the website located on
     the server to the web browser located on the client. --> HTTP
     (hyper text transfer protocol)
   - Web pages are written in format : hyper text (basic formatting of
     a text document to indicate instructions on how to present info
     in a web browser)
   - transfer to hyper text file using HTTP protocol
   - HTTP is an application layer protocol

** Presentation Layer
   
   [[file:pictures/osi_model_all_layers.png]]

   - ASCII for encoding text
   - EBCDIC used by IBM for encoding text
   - some protocol needed to convert both data format
   - Antiquated Layer

** Session Layer
   
   - also antiquated layer
