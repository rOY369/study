* OSI Model

  - Open Systems Interconnect
  - Watching youtube video
    - My system : wireless router through WiFi / LAN : ISP(Modem) :
      Internet : Youtube Server
    - Type in https://www.youtube.com
    - Goes to Youtube server --> pulls up the video
    - Transfers it to my system

** Physical Layer

   - wireless/wired cables (twister pair cables: non-identical)
   - modem - internet : CoAx cable
   - internet : fiber optics / wireless / copper
   - All of these cables and the protocols that define how those
     cables are constructed are physical layer
     protocols. Example : twister pair cabling require a very
     precise protocol to understand how to construct it, same
     thing with other types of cables. Even the wireless
     connections use electronmagnetic spectrum to transfer
     information.

** Data Link Layer

   - Protocols required to move information from one end of the cable
     to another end of the cable. So we end up having mini-network
     segments (marked as blue in the following picture)
   - A network segment is a collection of network devices that operate
     in the same space in the same protocol.
   - In each of the network segments in the picture, a specific
     protocol is used to manage and transfer the data.
