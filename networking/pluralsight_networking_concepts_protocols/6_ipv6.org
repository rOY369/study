* IPv6 addressing

  - IPv6 Address size
    - 4 times as long as IPv4
    - 128 bits => 32 nibbles => 8 hextets
    - 32 hexadecimal values
    - 2001:0DB8:0002:008D:0000:0000:00A5:52F5
    - Network portion : first 64 bits
    - Interface identifier / host portion : next 64 bits
    - /64 subnet mask
    - variable length subnet masking not used typically
    - How to shorten ?
      - eliminate leading 0's
      - replace consecutive 0's with `::`
      - only one instance of `::` should exist in an IPv6 address
    - 2^64 number of host addresses available one one IPv6 network out
      of possible 2^64 IPv6 networks

  - every single interface in IPv6, if its going to talk on a routed
    network will require at least 2 IPv6 addresses
    - global unicast address
    - link-local address only exists within the layer 2 kind of like
      mac address. it will never leave out of the local ethernet network.
  - IPv6 address acquisition
    - SLAC (stateless address auto configuration)
    - [[file:./pictures/slac.png]]
    - router will advertise the network portion of the IPv6 address
    - Windows system
      - pick a random 64 bit interface identifier (host portion)
    - Unix/Linux/Mac
      - Modified EUI - 64 format
      - modify mac address to 64 bits long : break the address in half
        and put FFFE in the middle : beginning of host portion
      - take the first 8 bits and flip the 7th value

  - IPv6 DHCP

  - IPv6 Tunneling
    - [[file:./pictures/ipv6_tunnel.png]]
    - we communicate with ipv6 internet by putting ipv6 packets inside
      ipv4 packet.
