* TCP

  - Transmission control protocol
  - This is layer-4 protocol
  - Example of transferring website from server --> client
    - telephone conversation protocol
    - For this, we have to establish a session between server and
      client. This will be specialised connection session which forms
      the base mechanism for any further transfer of data.
    - Both client and server throughout the session, give clues to
      each other whether they are receiving messages from other the
      other party. It also includes a protocol for ending the
      session.
